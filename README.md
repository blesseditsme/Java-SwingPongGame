# Java-SwingPongGame
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Pong" using Java's Swing framework. The game features two paddles and a ball, with the objective of bouncing the ball back and forth between the paddles while trying to avoid missing the ball. The code provides a basic game loop, collision detection, and paddle movement using keyboard input.

Introduction:
